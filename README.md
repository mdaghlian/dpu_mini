# dpu_mini 
Much revised version of dag_prf_utils
-> remove as many dependencies as possible
-> basic matplotlib plotting stuff + colormaps 
-> freesurfer integration + surface plots 

Remove all pycortex; nibabel etc. dependency. 
Why? Because trying to get environments to work with tensorflow + tensorflow probability is a massive headache

(also because I want a "shrunk" version anyway)


## In active development
This package is still in development and its API might change.
